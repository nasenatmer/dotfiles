Dotfiles with bone2 adaptions
=============================

A collection of my dotfiles used on a Archlinux `x86_64` box.

A special focus is set on tools that use `vi`-like `hjkl` navigation. I use some of them (`vim`, 
`ncmpcpp`, `zathura`) and adapted these to the [bone2 keyboard layout][1]. Additionally, some other 
programmes (`tmux`, `mplayer`) offer vi-like modes where I sought to adapt these, too.

 Feel free to take and use whatever you like!
