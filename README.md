Dotfiles with bone2 adaptions
=============================

A collection of my dotfiles used on a Archlinux `x86_64` box.

A special focus is set on tools that use `vi`-like `hjkl` navigation. I use 
some of them (`vim`, `ncmpcpp`, `zathura`) and adapted these to the [bone2 
keyboard layout][1]. Additionally, some other programmes (`tmux`, `mplayer`) 
offer vi-like modes where I sought to adapt these, too.

Feel free to take and use whatever you like!

A Note of Caution
=================

Please note that you can't just copy and paste any option to your settings, 
some might need plugins installed, so be sure to research that.

ZSH
===

My zsh configuration is set to use `vi-mode` and the motion keys are of course  adapted to bone2 as well.  
You can find my `.zshrc` in my [prezto][2] repository under `runcoms`.
