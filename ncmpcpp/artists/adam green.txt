Adam Green (born 1981) is an american singer-songwriter originally with the group The Moldy Peaches.  His former Moldy Peaches bandmate, Kimya Dawson, is now also a solo anti-folk artist. Green is now best known for the solo career he began in 2002.  His most famous (and notorious) song is probably, "Jessica", off 2003's full-length album, "Friends of Mine".

Often compared to Ben Folds, Leonard Cohen, Ben Kweller, and Jonathan Richman, Green's off-kilter indie alternative folk style has achieved a moderate college radio following in the United States and enjoys increasing popularity in different European countries, particularly Germany.

Green attended Emerson College for one semester in 1998 before leaving to concentrate on his music, going on to co-found the anti folk group The Moldy Peaches with Kimya Dawson.

In 2002 The Moldy Peaches went on hiatus and Green embarked on a solo career.

Green released several albums on Rough Trade Records. Among his better known songs are the aforementioned "Jessica" (about singer Jessica Simpson), "Novotel", "Friends of Mine", "Dance with Me", "Carolina" and "Emily", and, in Britain, his cover of The Libertines track "What a Waster".

Prior to Jacket Full of Danger in 2006, all of Green's albums had been released on the 22nd of the month. His latest album was released on March 18th, 2008 and is titled Sixes & Sevens. Titles include "Morning After Midnight," "Twee Twee Dee," and "Drowning Head First," the latter a duet between Green and his girlfriend.

In January 2008, The Moldy Peaches began having a resurgence in popularity, due to their music being included in the hit indie film Juno. Most notably, a duet between Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, The Moldy Peaches song "Anyone Else But You" was featured in the film, and also in a scene which features the films lead actors, Michael Cera and Ellen Page performing the song together. The soundtrack album reached #1 on the Billboard album chart on it's 3rd week of release.

Adam's brother Joel, an astronomer, has appeared as an accompanying musician on several recordings.

In Germany journalists often note that his great-grandmother, Felice Bauer, was engaged to Franz Kafka, who was born in Prague but wrote in German; his family fled the Nazis in the late 1930s and wound up in New York.

Green is a good friend of musician Carl Bar√¢t, appearing in a documentary with him, following the pair on a night out in London, for the European television culture channel Arte.

In 2007, Austin, Texas country singer-songwriter Kelly Willis covered Adam's "Teddy Boys" for her album Translated From Love.

Adam appeared with his mother, Leah, on an episode of Cash Cab, which aired originally in the United States on Thursday, April 10th.
